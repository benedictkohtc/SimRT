# The Over Glorified Screensaver

This game has been heavily inspired by a particular indie title which shall go unnamed. Hence, I take no credit for the core game mechanics and design.
Its essentially a mass rapid transit builder and simulator.

### How to Play

tldr: Build train lines, decide when and where to deploy trains, don't let any station overload.

You have 3 train lines and 5 trains available to you.
Stations are considered overloaded when they have more than 6 passengers waiting.

Building Tracks: Click on grids to design your railway network.
